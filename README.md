This app allows users to increment and decrement a counter value with the following features:

Increment Functionality: Adds 1 to the counter value, with a maximum limit of 20. An alert is shown if the limit is exceeded.
Decrement Functionality: Subtracts 1 from the counter value, with a minimum limit of 0. An alert is shown if the value goes below 0.
State Management: Utilizes React's useState hook for efficient state management.
